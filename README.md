# isochrone_fitting_example
We illustrate the usage of a forward model using the latest parsec isochrones with emcee to infer stellar parameters for single and binary stars

We show how single stars stellar parameters can be inferred and how for resolved binary systems (wide common proper motion binaries) the fact that both share the same age can be exploited.

We look into convergence criteria and also how mass production can be performed

The isochrones used are a downsampled version from https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132g4501R/abstract
